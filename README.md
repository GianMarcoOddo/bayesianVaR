# FAANG Stocks Portfolio Risk Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the FAANG Stocks Portfolio Risk Analysis repository. This project focuses on the analysis of the FAANG stocks—Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet (formerly Google)—in a portfolio context. These companies are leaders in technological innovation and have a significant impact on global investment trends, consumer habits, and technological advancements.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the risk associated with an equally weighted portfolio of FAANG stocks. We specifically examine how different variance-covariance matrix estimation techniques, including Bayesian statistics, influence the computation of Value at Risk (VaR) over a two-year period.

### Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Daily stock price data for each of the FAANG companies over the past two years.
- **Portfolio Construction**: Creation of an equally weighted portfolio, rebalanced daily.
- **Risk Assessment**: Analysis of portfolio risk using various variance-covariance matrix estimation techniques, with a focus on Bayesian statistics.
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Computation of VaR to quantify the potential loss in portfolio value.

### Why FAANG?

FAANG stocks are known for their large market capitalizations, exceptional growth potential, and significant influence on the stock market. Understanding the risk associated with these stocks in a portfolio is crucial for investors and risk managers, given their market power, volatility, and role in the tech-driven economy.

### Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian statistics offers a probabilistic approach to inference, incorporating prior knowledge along with new data to update the probability of outcomes. This technique is particularly useful in the estimation of the variance-covariance matrix, providing more robust and informed risk assessments for the FAANG portfolio.
